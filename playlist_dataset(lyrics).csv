With the wilt of the rose (ah-ha)
I slept all alone (ah-ha)
You still wouldn't go

Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for something greater
Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out
Baby, was it over then
And is it over now?

When you lost control (ah-ha)
Red blood, white snow (ah-ha)
Blue dress on a boat (ah-ha)

He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye

But he was so much fun and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when he said something wrong, he'd just fly me to France

And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me

And you were tossing me the car keys
""F- the patriarchy"" keychain on the ground
We were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down
Any time now, he's gonna say it's love
You never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame, and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

I got a man but I want you
I got a man but I want you
And it's just nerves, it's just—
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you
And you right

You right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you
Say, you right, I got my guy
But I, I can't help it, I want you

I can't stop and look the other way
'Cause I know what could be, babe
And you never feel the same
You'd be thinkin' 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairy tales
But we got our fantasies

And it's me and you, no she

(Don't stop, baby, you can walk)

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually, I put something on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, laying on the screen

You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

Sometimes all I think about is you

I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone

Painting stars up on your ceiling 'cause you
Wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, yeah
You know you can call me if you need someone

I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one to say we all make mistakes (we all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone
Feels to be someone who loses their way

You're looking for answers and a place I know (I know)
